## Drosophila Interactome Finder program files

This repository contains files for the Drosophila Interactome Finder (DIF) program. DIF is designed to leverage publically available data on https://flybase.org/ to help investigate and visualize interactions among a list of *Drosophila melanogaster* candidate genes, for instance from a genome-wide association study or different gene expression study. The manuscript describing the use of this tool is currently in preparation.
